        <p class="lead" >Scott Campbell is a graduate of Cal State Long Beach, Class of 1989. He studied Physical Therapy with great attention to anatomy, physiology, kinesiology, and exercise physiology. His 25 years of experience have  been exclusively in outpatient orthopedics in hospital and sports medicine settings. He has had extensive continuing education focusing on evaluation and treatment of musculoskeletal and neurological injuries.</p>

        <p class="lead"> He is fully equipped to assess and treat a variety of injuries. He  treats a wide array of conditions including sprains, strains, fractures and dislocations, post-surgical conditions, total joint replacements, and chronic pain. He has had success in balance training and general conditioning for patients that are a high fall risk.  After careful evaluation, he implements a plan of care based on the specific findings of the evaluation. He utilizes a very hands-on approach to address the specific needs of each individual patient.  He gives each patient a home exercise program and a strategy to return to any given activity. This would include activities of daily living and/or participation in high-level sports.   </p>

        

        <p class="lead">Scott has always had a love for the outdoors. As a young boy, Scott spent many of his summers at the water skiing at the lake while barbequeing with family and friends. He loves his job and the area as he describes driving to work as his daily adventure. Outside of work, Scott enjoys a multitude of outdoor activities such as backpacking, skiing, and cycling.
