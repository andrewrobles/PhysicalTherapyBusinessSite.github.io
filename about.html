        <p class="lead" >Since opening for business over a decade ago, Scott Campbell Physical Therapy has been a leading independent orthopedic rehabilitation center dedicated to optimal, cost effective outcomes. We accomplish this with expert care delivered in a state-of-the-art treatment facility, but importantly, we partner with the patient to resolve their particular condition  through education, home care interventions, and understanding their occupational goals and/or requirements. We are honored to have referral support of physicians and surgeons throughout Ventura County, and are proud of the consistent patient to patient recommendations that we receive each day.</p>

        <p class="lead" >Scott Campbell is fully equipped to assess and treat a variety of injuries. He treats a wide array of conditions including sprains, strains, fractures and dislocations, post-surgical conditions, total joint replacements, and chronic pain. He has had success in balance training and general conditioning for patients that are a high fall risk. After careful evaluation, he implements a plan of care based on the specific findings of the evaluation. He utilizes a very hands-on approach to address the specific needs of each individual patient. He gives each patient a home exercise program and a strategy to return to any given activity. This would include activities of daily living and/or participation in high-level sports.  </p>

        <p class="lead" >Scott has gained a reputation as being a leading rehabilitation and treatment center whose core philosophy is to interact with patients as much as possible in order to ensure customer satisfaction. </p>

        <p class="lead" >In order to make an appointment, please call (310) 456-9705 between the hours of 8AM and 5PM. The clinic is located in the Malibu Urgent Care building at 23656 Pacific Coast Highway, Malibu, CA. Please walk into the front doors and ask for Scott Campbell--we are located towards the back of the building. </p>
